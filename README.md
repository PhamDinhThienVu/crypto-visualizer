# crypto-visualizer
Interactive web tool that visualizes encryption and re-encryption processes step by step, including game save file formats (e.g. Grim Quest) for educational purposes.

## ✨ Features
- Step-by-step encryption visualization
- Re-encode game save files
- Algorithm explanation
- Upload and process text or save files
- Export visualization steps as JSON (backend optional)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
For educational and research purposes only.  
This project is not intended for production use or to bypass game security mechanisms.

## 🔑 Available Algorithms
- Base64 (encode/decode, step visualization)
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) – planned
- RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) – planned
- SHA family (hash functions) – planned
